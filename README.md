# HossamX-Sentiment-Analysis with Neural Networks

## Description

This project focuses on sentiment analysis using neural networks and natural language processing techniques. It leverages a combination of Word2Vec for word embeddings and a Keras-based neural network for sentiment classification. The project is particularly useful for analyzing sentiments in textual data, offering insights into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.

## Installation

To set up this project, you need to install various dependencies:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/hossamxstudios/HossamX-Sentiment-Analysis
cd HossamX-Sentiment-Analysis

# Install required Python packages
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib nltk gensim tensorflow scikit-learn
```

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with pip package manager.

## Data

The project uses a text dataset (e.g., `data.csv`) for training and testing. The dataset should include text samples and corresponding sentiment labels.

## Usage

To run the sentiment analysis, execute the following:

```python
# Load the model and tokenizer
from keras.models import load_model
import joblib

model = load_model('final_model.h5')
tokenizer = joblib.load('tokenizer.pkl')

# Use the model for predictions
def predict_sentiment(text):
    # Preprocess the text
    # [Add preprocessing steps here]
    
    # Predict and return sentiment
    return model.predict([processed_text])

# Example
print(predict_sentiment("The movie was fantastic!"))
```

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning and tokenizing text data.
- **Word2Vec Embeddings**: Uses Gensim's Word2Vec for generating word embeddings.
- **Neural Network Classification**: A Keras-based model for classifying sentiments.
- **Model Evaluation**: Code for evaluating model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.
